# Dipole moment & wavefunction in strong-field approximation

by Wei-Chun Chu (2015)

This code is to calculate dipole moment and wave function of simple
atomic systems driven by an arbitrary linearly polarized electric field.
The model is based on the semi-classical strong-field approximation
(SFA) by Lewenstein et. al. [M. Lewenstein, Ph. Balcou, M. Yu. Ivanov,
Anne L'Huillier, and P. B. Corkum, Phys. Rev. A 49, 2117 (1994)].

Simply compile sfaq.tex with latex to read the short description of the
algorithm used in the code.

All codes are written in FORTRAN 90 and OpenMP. A sample compilation
command is in the file "compile". Example configuration files are in
the folder "examples".
